            ring hit no targets.

            Accuracy fix: previous versions (incorrectly) excluded pet/guardian
            damage; this has been fixed. Fixed some other minor issues. Minor
            display improvement, performance improvement. Name was changed to
            reflect that it works for all DPS rings, not just `Nithramus`.

            Accuracy fix: damage bonus % is now exact, unrounded number. Fixed
            an issue where aura wouldn't deactivate if player died. (None of
            you experienced this issue, b/c if you die you're bad, and you're
            not bad right?)

        Shows the CD on your legendary ring, or the remaining buff time if it's
        active. Indicates the status of your own ring only (so it won't trigger
        if someone activates it out of range). Note: It plays a sound on
        activation, which it reads off the `Actions > On Hide` section.
        You can customize it/turn it off there.

            Fixed wrong time being displayed when 30-sec CD was triggered (e.g.
            from reequipping the ring). Now automatically hides itself if the
            ring is not equipped.
