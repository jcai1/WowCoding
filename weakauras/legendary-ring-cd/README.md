## L.Ring CD (Self)

Shows the CD on your legendary ring, or the remaining buff time if it's active.
Indicates the status of your own ring only (so it won't trigger if someone
activates it out of range). Note: It plays a sound on activation, which it reads
off the `Actions > On Hide` section. You can customize it/turn it off there.

**Classes**: All

**Requested by**: Arc
