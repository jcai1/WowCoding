## L.Ring CD (Self)

Shows the CD on your legendary ring, or the remaining buff time if it's active.
Indicates the status of your own ring only (so it won't trigger if someone
activates it out of range). Note: It plays a sound on activation, which it reads
off the `Actions > On Hide` section. You can customize it/turn it off there.

**Classes**: All

**Requested by**: Arc

Fixed wrong time being displayed when 30-sec CD was triggered (e.g. from
reequipping the ring). Now automatically hides itself if the ring is not
equipped.
