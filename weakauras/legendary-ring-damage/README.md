### Changes

#### v0.7 (2016-07-20):

Fixed for Legion pre-patch.


#### v0.6:

Fixed an issue where aura wouldn't deactivate if player died, and ring hit no
targets.


#### v0.5:

Accuracy fix: previous versions (incorrectly) excluded pet/guardian damage; this
has been fixed. Fixed some other minor issues. Minor display improvement,
performance improvement. Name was changed to reflect that it works for all DPS
rings, not just `Nithramus`.


#### v0.4:

Accuracy fix: damage bonus % is now exact, unrounded number. Fixed an issue
where aura wouldn't deactivate if player died. (None of you experienced this
issue, b/c if you die you're bad, and you're not bad right?)


#### v0.3:

Accuracy fixes: no longer counts overkill or self-inflicted damage (such as
`Burning Rush`).


#### v0.2:

Should have fixed the `Prismatic Crystal` double-counting issue.
