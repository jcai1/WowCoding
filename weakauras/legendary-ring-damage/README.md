### Changes

#### v0.7 (2016-07-20):

Fixed for Legion pre-patch.


#### v0.6 (2016-04-09):

Fixed an issue where aura wouldn't deactivate if player died, and ring hit no
targets.


#### v0.5 (2016-03-09):

Accuracy fix: previous versions (incorrectly) excluded pet/guardian damage; this
has been fixed. Fixed some other minor issues. Minor display improvement,
performance improvement. Name was changed to reflect that it works for all DPS
rings, not just `Nithramus`.


#### v0.4 (2015-12-19):

Accuracy fix: damage bonus % is now exact, unrounded number. Fixed an issue
where aura wouldn't deactivate if player died. (None of you experienced this
issue, b/c if you die you're bad, and you're not bad right?)


#### v0.3 (2015-12-18):

Accuracy fixes: no longer counts overkill or self-inflicted damage (such as
`Burning Rush`).


#### v0.2 (2015-11-09):

Should have fixed the `Prismatic Crystal` double-counting issue.


#### v0.1:

Initial release.
