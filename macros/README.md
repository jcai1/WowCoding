## List of Macros
- `NPFriendlyClick`: Toggles whether you can click on friendly NPC nameplates (when friendly nameplates are enabled). Cannot be used in combat.
- `NPFriendlyNPC`: Toggles whether you can see friendly NPC nameplates (when friendly nameplates are enabled). Cannot be used in combat.
- `use-artifact-power`: You can spam this to use all artifact power items in your inventory. It avoids using the 100 artifact power BoA items. It is slower than clicking them manually, and it misses some special items.
- `inventory-af-power`: Shows how much total artifact power is in your inventory. Due to macro length limitations, this is rather slow. The WeakAura [Artifact Power Total](../weakauras/artifact-power-total) is recommended instead.
