## Target Threat Situation

Shows a subset of your target's threat table in a text display (including the
primary target, the top threat tank, the top threat non-tank, and yourself).
Plays an audio alert if you're in a tank spec and a non-tank has aggro or top
threat. You can adjust options under `Actions > On Init` custom code.
